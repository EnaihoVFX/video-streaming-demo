AI Video Compression System

üîß Setup Instructions

1. Activate the Virtual Environment

source tf_env/bin/activate

This activates the Python virtual environment necessary to run the AI compression scripts.

2. Start Training the Model

Option A: Basic Training (Not Ideal)

python3 ai_compression.py --input 1.mp4 --train

Uses 1.mp4 as the training video.

This is a minimal clip and not ideal for training.

Option B: Recommended High-Quality Training

python3 ai_compression.py --input 2.mp4 --train

Uses 2.mp4, a high-quality 4K video of a 360¬∞ walk in the park.

Provides significantly better results and is recommended for serious training.

üìà Expanding Training Data

To further improve model performance:

Search for training clips on Google or YouTube.

Prioritize footage with 4K resolution or well-lit 1080p quality.

If the footage appears high quality to the human eye, it is likely suitable.

Aim for 20,000 to 40,000 frames of training data.

Allow the training process to run until fully complete for best results.

üîÑ Running the Model for Live Input

python3 ai_compression.py --input webcam

Runs the model with live webcam input.

Useful for previewing real-time AI-based decompression and frame restoration.

üß† How the System Works

The AI compresses each video frame into a very small image (approximately 4‚Äì6 KB).

Converts this into vector data which represents the frame semantically.

Decompresses the frame back into a high-resolution version (1‚Äì20 MB), preserving or reconstructing image detail.

üåç Use Cases

Video Streaming: Reduces bandwidth requirements dramatically.

Intelligent Frame Editing: AI-understood frames can be directly manipulated by intelligent systems to produce highly accurate image edits.

Efficient Training Transfers: Compress full video datasets into ultra-light files (~10 KB) and expand back to full size client-side, replacing heavy 10 GB datasets.

üöÄ Future Development Plans

We are actively improving the AI model to become more advanced and modular:

Detail Prediction: The model will infer and reconstruct missing or unclear details in frames, going beyond simple restoration.

Improved Frame Generation: Rebuilt frames may exceed the quality of the originals through enhancement techniques.

Adaptive Compression:

The AI will dynamically balance compression ratio vs. computational load.

During high server load (e.g., livestreams), the model can reduce compression to ease server-side expansion.

A priority-based ordering algorithm will allocate server resources to high-demand users first.

üìπ Handling Pre-recorded Videos

Video files are broken down into:

Raw footage

Edited versions

Highlight clips

During upload:

The AI generates a transcript.

Timestamps of important moments are extracted.

Non-essential frames are discarded or heavily compressed.

The system recombines:

Compressed raw footage

Model data

Highlight and editing metadata

The final, optimized video is uploaded to the blockchain platform.

üåê Web3 Integration and Vision

This project aims to reimagine content creation, distribution, and monetization using AI and decentralized infrastructure.

Blockchain Integration: Built for Polkadot and Avalanche.

Planned Expansion: Ethereum, Solana, and other networks.

Platform Features:

Cross-network interoperability for dApps.

Content creator monetization:

Uploads are tokenized as NFTs.

Creators choose the network (Polkadot, Avalanche, Solana, Ethereum).

Each creator's video is minted as an NFT and hosted on the network. Advertisements embedded within the video are paid for directly on-chain, with the payment routed into the associated NFT smart contract. This creates a direct, traceable link between ad revenue and the NFT's on-chain value. As the video receives more views and ad interactions, the NFT accrues real economic value, backed by verifiable ad payments. This system ensures that a video's popularity and monetization are transparently reflected in the NFT‚Äôs worth, enabling creators to earn in real time and investors to assess value based on actual viewer engagement and ad revenue performance.

AI Agent Interoperability:

An embedded AI agent communicates across dApps and networks.

Facilitates secure and efficient data sharing and streaming between ecosystems.

üîÑ Reimagining Content Platforms

Our end goal is to create a decentralized social media and content platform where:

AI and blockchain fuse to optimize bandwidth, storage, and processing.

Creators earn what their content is truly worth.

Data flows freely and efficiently across networks.

Content is smarter, lighter, and more interactive than ever before.
