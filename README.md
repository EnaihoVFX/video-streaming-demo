# AI Video Compression System

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
source tf_env/bin/activate
```

This command activates the Python virtual environment necessary to run the AI compression scripts.

### 2. Start Training the Model

#### Option A: Basic Training *(Not Recommended)*

```bash
python3 ai_compression.py --input 1.mp4 --train
```

* Uses `1.mp4` as the training video.
* This is a minimal, low-quality clip and not ideal for effective training.

#### Option B: High-Quality Recommended Training

```bash
python3 ai_compression.py --input 2.mp4 --train
```

* Uses `2.mp4`, a 4K video of a 360° walk in the park.
* Provides significantly better results and is recommended for serious training.

---

## 📈 Expanding Training Data

To further enhance model accuracy and generalization:

* Search for video clips on **YouTube** or **Google**.
* Prioritize:

  * **4K resolution** videos.
  * **1080p** videos with **good lighting**.
  * Anything visually high-quality to the human eye.
* Target training with **20,000 – 40,000 frames**.
* Allow training to run **until fully complete** for best performance.

---

## 🔄 Running the Model with Live Input

```bash
python3 ai_compression.py --input webcam
```

* Initiates the model in real-time mode using webcam footage.
* Useful for testing live AI decompression and vector-based interpretation.

---

## 🧠 How the System Works

* Each video frame is compressed to a **4–6 KB image**.
* Converted into **vector data**, understood by the AI model.
* Decompressed back into a **1–20 MB high-resolution frame**.
* This allows massive compression without losing semantic meaning.

---

## 🌍 Use Cases

* **Video Streaming**: Reduce bandwidth usage while maintaining quality.
* **AI Editing Pipelines**: Enable precise, intelligent manipulation of video frames.
* **Efficient AI Training Transfer**: Replace large datasets (e.g., 10 GB) with lightweight compressed files (\~10 KB), then expand client-side.

---

## 🚀 Future Development Plans

We are working to make the system more powerful, modular, and scalable:

### 🔬 Advanced Capabilities

* **Detail Prediction**: AI will infer missing details with high accuracy.
* **Enhanced Frame Generation**: Regenerated frames may surpass original quality.

### 🧪 Adaptive Compression

* Balances **compression ratio** and **client/server computation load**.
* During heavy usage (e.g., livestreams), compression can be reduced to ease server stress.
* **Ordering algorithms** will allocate server resources based on real-time demand.

## 📹 Handling Pre-recorded Videos

1. **Video Decomposition**:

   * Raw footage
   * Edited versions
   * Highlight clips

2. **AI Processing**:

   * Transcripts with timestamps are generated.
   * Non-relevant frames are discarded or heavily compressed.

3. **Recombination**:

   * Raw footage + Model data + Highlight/edit metadata.
   * Final content is uploaded to the **blockchain platform**.

## 🌐 Web3 Integration & Vision

### 🔗 Blockchain Foundations

* Built for **Polkadot** and **Avalanche**.
* Planned integration with **Ethereum**, **Solana**, and more.

### 📊 Creator Monetization via NFTs

* Every video is minted as an **NFT**.
* **Embedded ads** are paid for directly **on-chain**.
* Ad revenue flows into the NFT's smart contract, creating a **real-time valuation mechanism**.
* As views and ad interactions grow, the NFT's on-chain value increases.
* This creates a **transparent, decentralized economic model**:

  * Creators are paid instantly and proportionally.
  * Investors can assess value based on **verifiable viewership** and **ad revenue performance**.

### 🧠 AI Agent Interoperability

* An embedded **AI agent** bridges dApps across networks.
* Manages **secure cross-chain communication**.
* Facilitates seamless data sharing, streaming, and AI-based media control.

## 🔄 Reimagining Content Platforms

Our mission is to redefine how content is created, consumed, and monetized:

* AI + Blockchain = **Maximum efficiency** in bandwidth, storage, and processing.
* Creators are paid based on **true value**—not views alone, but engagement and ad interaction.
* All content is **decentralized**, **compressible**, **verifiable**, and **interoperable**.
* Users will:

  * Discover and interact with NFT-anchored videos.
  * Use micro-ad revenue to support creators directly.
  * Invest in creators by owning fractional shares of popular videos.

### 🌐 Social Media Use Cases

* **Decentralized Video Sharing**: Users upload, tokenize, and monetize content.
* **Cross-Chain Interaction**: Videos live across multiple networks—Ethereum, Polkadot, Avalanche, Solana.
* **Creator Autonomy**: Total ownership of content, earnings, and data.
* **Community Engagement**: Fans and investors participate in content value growth.
* **AI-Powered Discovery**: Smart recommendations and auto-highlights from compressed content.

We’re building a future where content is lighter, smarter, decentralized, and creator-first.
